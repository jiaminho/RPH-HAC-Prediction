## RPH-HAC-Prediction
Predicting Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) in collaboration with Royal Perth Hospital.

This project aims to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) from patient data. Our goal is to improve healthcare decision-making by providing clinicians with a predictive model that identifies patients with higher risk of HACs, enabling them to take proactive preventive measures.
