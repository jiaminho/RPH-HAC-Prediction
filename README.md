## RPH-HAC-Prediction
Predicting Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) in collaboration with Royal Perth Hospital.

### Overview
This project aims to use machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics to predict Hospital Acquired Complications (HACs) from historical patient data. Our goal is to improve healthcare decision-making by providing clinicians with a predictive model that identifies patients with higher risk of HACs, enabling them to take proactive preventive measures.

### Background
Hospital-acquired complications (HACs) are infections or other complications that patients acquire while receiving care in a healthcare facility. It represents a significant burden on patients' health and the healthcare system as a whole, contributing to longer hospital stays, increased mortality, readmission risk, and higher healthcare costs. In Australia, one in nine admissions involved a HAC, and the incidence increased to one in four admissions among overnight admissions in 2018. HACs were shown to be associated with more than 10 days of additional length of hospital stay per episode and four fold increase in hospital costs in Australia. HACs are difficult to detect due to their similarity with symptoms of underlying conditions and the gradual or delayed onset of some complications. Despite these challenges, early detection of HACs is important for several reasons. It allows for prompt treatment and intervention, which can prevent complications from worsening and reduce the risk of long-term health consequences. It also enables healthcare providers to implement preventive measures and interventions, such as improved infection control practices, appropriate antibiotic therapy, or adjustments in treatment plans. Additionally, identifying HACs early can help prevent their transmission to other patients, thereby improving overall patient safety within the healthcare facility. Currently, at Royal Perth Hospital, extensive multimodal datasets encompassing physiological parameters, pathology results, diagnostic text and demographics are maintained. These datasets present a vast resource for developing predictive models. However, the data is complex and can be challenging to interpret due to its multimodal nature. Thus, the hospital is keen on exploring ways to utilize this data to predict the risk of acquiring HACs. 

### Usage
Detailed Jupyter Notebooks are provided for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
